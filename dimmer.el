;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This module provides a minor mode that indicates which buffer is
;; currently active by dimming the faces in the other buffers.  It
;; does this nondestructively, and computes the dimmed faces
;; dynamically such that your overall color scheme is shown in a muted
;; form without requiring you to define what is a "dim" version of
;; every face.
;;
;; The `default` background color is the target for all dimming
;; calculations.  If your default background is "white" then faces
;; will be made brighter when "dimmed".  If your default background is
;; a dark blue, then faces will be shifted "darker" and "more blue"
;; when buffers are dimmed.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;      (require 'dimmer) ; unless installed as a package
;;      (dimmer-mode)
;;
;; Customization:
;;
;; `dimmer-fraction` controls the degree to which buffers are dimmed.
;; Range is 0.0 - 1.0, and default is 0.20.  Increase value if you
;; like the other buffers to be more dim.
;;
;; `dimmer-exclusion-regexp` can be used to specify buffers that
;; should never be dimmed.  If the buffer name matches this regexp
;; then `dimmer.el` will not dim that buffer.
;;
;; `dimmer-use-colorspace` allows you to specify what color space the
;; dimming calculation is performed in.  In the majority of cases you
;; won't need to touch this setting.  See the docstring below for more
;; information.

Choices are :cielab (default), :hsl, or :rgb.

CIELAB is the default, and in most cases should serve perfectly
well.  As a colorspace it attempts to be uniform to the human
eye, meaning the degree of dimming should be roughly the same for
all your foreground colors.

Bottom line: If CIELAB is working for you, then you don't need to
experiment with the other choices.

However, interpolating in CIELAB introduces one wrinkle, in that
mathematically it's possible to generate a color that isn't
representable on your RGB display (colors having one or more RGB
channel values < 0.0 or > 1.0).  When dimmer finds an
\"impossible\" RGB value like that it simply clamps that value to
fit in the range 0.0 - 1.0.  Clamping like this can lead to some
colors looking \"wrong\".  If you think the dimmed values look
wrong, then try HSV or RGB instead."
